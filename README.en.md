## What's NanUI

NanUI is an open source .NET/.NET Core component for Windows Form Applications. It's suitable for .NET/.NET Core developers who wants to use front-end technologies suc as HTMM5/CSS3/JavaScript to design the user interface of Windows Form Applications.

NanUI is based on Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF), so users can use various front-end technologies such as HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript and popular front-end frameworks such as React/Vue/Angular/Blazor to design and develop the user interface of .NET desktop applications.

And NanUI's JavaScript Bridge can facilitate communication and data exchange between the browser and .NET enviroment.

Using NanUI will bring unlimited possibilities for your WinForms application development work!

### Documentation

- [Documentation](docs/documentation.md)

### Example

A comprehensive demonstration project, FormiumClient, is included in the project source code. Through the source code of this project, you can quickly learn the relevant knowledge of NanUI and master how to use HTML/CSS/JavaScript to create your Windows applications.

- [formium-client-frontend](src/frontends/formium-client/)

   The front-end code of the sample project is written in ReactJS.
